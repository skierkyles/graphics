Make one of the small spheres from the last assignment a perfect mirror.



Also add a "light" sphere at

center (0, 10, 0) radius 1

which is always color (1,1,1) for any ray that hits it.



Extra credit: add refraction for a "hollow" sphere defined as a sphere of radius 1 and another with the same center and radius 0.9
